Step-by-Step Instructions to Start This Project Locally

Clone the Repository
If the project is hosted on GitHub, clone it using the following command:
git clone <repository_url>
Replace <repository_url> with the URL of your GitHub repository.
Navigate to the Project Directory
Move into the project's directory:
cd <project_folder_name>

Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:
On Windows:
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate


Install Project Dependencies
Install the required packages from the requirements.txt file:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of your project.
Add the following environment variables (adjust values as needed):

OPEN_AI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
REDIS_HOST = credentials
REDIS_PORT = credentials
Replace your_openai_api_key and your_github_personal_access_token with the appropriate API keys.

Install Redis Locally (Optional but Recommended)
If Redis is not installed locally:
Install Redis:
On macOS: Use Homebrew: brew install redis.
On Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install redis-server.
On Windows: Download Redis from Redis for Windows.

Start the Redis server:
redis-server

Run the Application
Start the FastAPI app using Uvicorn:
uvicorn main:app --reload
Replace main with the name of your Python file containing the FastAPI app if different.

Access the Application
http://127.0.0.1:8000

Use tools like Postman or curl to test the endpoints.
Alternatively, you can explore the automatically generated Swagger UI at:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

How can I make the perfomance of the project much faster
I can optimize handling larger repositories and a higher volume of requests by introducing asynchronous processing with task queues like 
Celery or RQ, backed by a robust Redis setup for task queuing and caching. For caching, Redis can be used to store intermediate results, 
such as repository metadata or preprocessed file contents, to minimize redundant API calls. Switch to a scalable database like PostgreSQL 
to store repository analysis results and user-specific data for efficient retrieval. Additionally, implement rate limiting and batching for 
GitHub API calls to handle larger repositories more effectively, and use paginated API requests. To further enhance scalability, deploy the 
application using Docker and Kubernetes, enabling horizontal scaling to manage increased workloads efficiently.
